"When I began to ransack the archives of the National Academy of Music I was at once struck by the surprising coincidences between the phenomena ascribed to the ""ghost"" and the most extraordinary and fantastic tragedy that ever excited the Paris upper classes; and I soon conceived the idea that this tragedy might reasonably be explained by the phenomena in question."	neutral	[0.7418114  0.16750199 0.04032784 0.05035887]	sad	[0.         0.24325109 0.57193832 0.14315765]
The events do not date more than thirty years back; and it would not be difficult to find at the present day, in the foyer of the ballet, old men of the highest respectability, men upon whose word one could absolutely rely, who would remember as though they happened yesterday the mysterious and dramatic conditions that attended the kidnapping of Christine Daae, the disappearance of the Vicomte de Chagny and the death of his elder brother, Count Philippe, whose body was found on the bank of the lake that exists in the lower cellars of the Opera on the Rue-Scribe side.	neutral	[0.8980729  0.04214957 0.024495   0.03528247]	sad	[0.         0.26433576 0.29037866 0.23574633]

The truth was slow to enter my mind, puzzled by an inquiry that at every moment was complicated by events which, at first sight, might be looked upon as superhuman; and more than once I was within an ace of abandoning a task in which I was exhausting myself in the hopeless pursuit of a vain image.	neutral	[0.5450122  0.10286546 0.1846334  0.16748896]	sad	[0.         0.22131072 0.36243882 0.27769421]
At last, I received the proof that my presentiments had not deceived me, and I was rewarded for all my efforts on the day when I acquired the certainty that the Opera ghost was more than a mere shade.	neutral	[0.59892505 0.15419994 0.09699209 0.14988284]	sad	[0.         0.25707659 0.31781808 0.2822212 ]
"On that day, I had spent long hours over THE MEMOIRS OF A MANAGER, the light and frivolous work of the too-skeptical Moncharmin, who, during his term at the Opera, understood nothing of the mysterious behavior of the ghost and who was making all the fun of it that he could at the very moment when he became the first victim of the curious financial operation that went on inside the ""magic envelope."""	neutral	[0.7947547  0.08411167 0.05635662 0.06477702]	sad	[0.         0.28405891 0.38230434 0.2101143 ]
I had just left the library in despair, when I met the delightful acting-manager of our National Academy, who stood chatting on a landing with a lively and well-groomed little old man, to whom he introduced me gaily.	neutral	[0.7746364  0.0790524  0.03295913 0.11335211]	sad	[0.         0.25061595 0.55738145 0.14506041]

Nobody knew what had become of him, alive or dead; and here he was back from Canada, where he had spent fifteen years, and the first thing he had done, on his return to Paris, was to come to the secretarial offices at the Opera and ask for a free seat.	neutral	[0.8937752  0.04331123 0.0111573  0.05175626]	happy	[0.         0.32819026 0.2775354  0.19956363]

He was bound to conclude in favor of the madness of the viscount and the accidental death of the elder brother, for lack of evidence to the contrary; but he was nevertheless persuaded that a terrible tragedy had taken place between the two brothers in connection with Christine Daae.	angry	[0.23612379 0.01459945 0.19782296 0.55145377]	sad	[0.         0.20016017 0.43781641 0.26188442]

He, too, had been told of the curious manifestations that seemed to point to the existence of an abnormal being, residing in one of the most mysterious corners of the Opera, and he knew the story of the envelope; but he had never seen anything in it worthy of his attention as magistrate in charge of the Chagny case, and it was as much as he had done to listen to the evidence of a witness who appeared of his own accord and declared that he had often met the ghost.	neutral	[9.9436814e-01 3.4239902e-03 7.4657879e-04 1.4613093e-03]	sad	[0.         0.234773   0.33514856 0.27763625]

I was at first inclined to be suspicious; but when the Persian had told me, with child-like candor, all that he knew about the ghost and had handed me the proofs of the ghost's existence--including the strange correspondence of Christine Daae--to do as I pleased with, I was no longer able to doubt.	neutral	[0.8234185  0.11994585 0.02581955 0.03081611]	happy	[0.         0.33238167 0.30427879 0.27839421]

I have, I know, been told that this correspondence may have been forged from first to last by a man whose imagination had certainly been fed on the most seductive tales; but fortunately I discovered some of Christine's writing outside the famous bundle of letters and, on a comparison between the two, all my doubts were removed.	neutral	[0.7772521  0.16247328 0.01954718 0.0407275 ]	angry	[0.         0.24398884 0.23575286 0.37207039]

This, moreover, was the opinion of the more serious people who, at one time or other, were mixed up in the Chagny case, who were friends of the Chagny family, to whom I showed all my documents and set forth all my inferences.	neutral	[0.86961365 0.07850797 0.0505282  0.00135023]	sad	[0.         0.31489543 0.34361713 0.22112994]
In this connection, I should like to print a few lines which I received from General D----:  SIR:  I can not urge you too strongly to publish the results of your inquiry.	neutral	[9.6290314e-01 3.3209205e-02 7.8199926e-04 3.1056269e-03]	angry	[0.         0.22895184 0.25874841 0.29828145]
"I remember perfectly that, a few weeks before the disappearance of that great singer, Christine Daae, and the tragedy which threw the whole of the Faubourg Saint-Germain into mourning, there was a great deal of talk, in the foyer of the ballet, on the subject of the ""ghost;"" and I believe that it only ceased to be discussed in consequence of the later affair that excited us all so greatly."	sad	[0.37127668 0.12455601 0.4540876  0.05007973]	sad	[0.         0.27074586 0.51507527 0.17452361]

For the present, I must conclude this very necessary introduction by thanking M.
