Down the Rabbit-Hole  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?'	neutral	[8.6065674e-01 9.7102178e-03 1.2934366e-01 2.8930124e-04]	happy	[0.         0.29214633 0.23732766 0.26199089]
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.	neutral	[0.80652046 0.15484041 0.00957376 0.02906535]	happy	[0.         0.2969872  0.26771291 0.26010529]
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!	neutral	[0.64752996 0.34450153 0.00725548 0.000713  ]	sad	[0.         0.37855941 0.50492376 0.07760532]

(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.	neutral	[0.7627659  0.08162815 0.05355991 0.10204604]	happy	[0.         0.28538099 0.2721541  0.27163578]
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.	neutral	[9.9431944e-01 1.6604001e-03 3.6258567e-03 3.9419252e-04]	happy	[0.         0.22455652 0.19393339 0.20683738]
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.	neutral	[0.98807806 0.00701405 0.00347154 0.00143631]	angry	[0.         0.25006021 0.25430431 0.26310158]
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.	neutral	[0.60392493 0.06407578 0.10385557 0.22814363]	sad	[0.         0.28198615 0.31496197 0.22221045]
First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.	neutral	[9.8219448e-01 2.4964637e-03 1.4937285e-02 3.7166086e-04]	sad	[0.         0.28477464 0.31319583 0.20143018]
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.	neutral	[0.9482926  0.00768796 0.03877392 0.00524539]	angry	[0.         0.22250134 0.29741204 0.31559763]

Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) '--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?'	neutral	[9.85952854e-01 1.98575901e-03 9.54408199e-04 1.11069735e-02]	happy	[0.         0.4143608  0.28872459 0.17357137]

She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?'	neutral	[0.8861224  0.03680981 0.01657753 0.06049025]	sad	[0.         0.29694737 0.37772447 0.21570814]

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.	neutral	[0.5129693  0.11736865 0.20704453 0.16261747]	sad	[0.         0.23796782 0.28351407 0.2657224 ]
There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!'	happy	[0.333078   0.51951915 0.04811635 0.0992865 ]	happy	[0.         0.27300946 0.26733389 0.25764809]
She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.	neutral	[9.9255931e-01 4.8920121e-03 1.6279995e-03 9.2066260e-04]	happy	[0.         0.3219064  0.28522352 0.2209543 ]
There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.	neutral	[0.97822434 0.01332296 0.00167477 0.00677798]	sad	[0.         0.22626154 0.4802543  0.14952493]
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!	neutral	[0.89809567 0.05658876 0.0226138  0.02270174]	sad	[0.         0.29864168 0.38326777 0.21450061]

However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!	neutral	[0.87651604 0.10184006 0.00826502 0.01337883]	happy	[0.         0.419687   0.23722849 0.23440154]
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.	neutral	[0.9016807  0.03359435 0.06042892 0.00429606]	happy	[0.         0.25440378 0.2274704  0.23246976]
How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders.	sad	[0.28142422 0.20821084 0.5066895  0.00367548]	sad	[0.         0.25693117 0.3554828  0.23077515]

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.	neutral	[0.94354814 0.0285995  0.00130523 0.02654719]	happy	[0.         0.29985206 0.27003604 0.26314936]

"'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked ""poison"" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later."	neutral	[0.82033974 0.02281979 0.01957709 0.13726339]	sad	[0.         0.25674821 0.30812133 0.30803737]

It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.	neutral	[0.3586855  0.28983116 0.0993512  0.2521321 ]	happy	[0.         0.32747187 0.21659939 0.28346795]

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.	neutral	[0.44031706 0.39106393 0.0331021  0.13551691]	happy	[0.         0.35094277 0.27867468 0.26198882]

Pig and Pepper  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.	neutral	[9.8660362e-01 3.0644443e-03 4.7135758e-04 9.8605463e-03]	angry	[0.         0.23304708 0.24821489 0.37843543]

Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; 'and besides, what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'	neutral	[0.917883   0.06110682 0.00611627 0.01489387]	sad	[0.         0.27548378 0.28903107 0.24588348]

The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.	neutral	[0.5066498  0.06600832 0.01603897 0.41130286]	angry	[0.         0.25273744 0.24172277 0.30043398]

The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.	neutral	[0.8085175  0.04252085 0.02852144 0.12044021]	happy	[0.         0.31462268 0.26245008 0.2691808 ]

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.	neutral	[0.8134231  0.08605457 0.02203174 0.07849057]	angry	[0.         0.20458554 0.34590988 0.38366453]
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.	neutral	[0.7204883  0.04925987 0.21833023 0.01192155]	angry	[0.         0.23458742 0.26726968 0.31011241]
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.	happy	[8.7108739e-02 8.9211410e-01 2.0773789e-02 3.2653063e-06]	happy	[0.         0.44408348 0.31610485 0.15170326]
