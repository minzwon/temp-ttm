Down the Rabbit-Hole  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversations?'	neutral	[0.92333627 0.01001509 0.00859952 0.04046055 0.01129029 0.00629829]	surprised	[0.         0.16808319 0.17472104 0.16132    0.17364467 0.16355233]
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.	neutral	[0.49887925 0.18103418 0.08088448 0.02596559 0.02105776 0.19217874]	scary	[0.         0.17068671 0.16265638 0.16795881 0.17448913 0.16735033]

(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.	neutral	[0.49907267 0.1774611  0.22964382 0.01819264 0.04206201 0.0335677 ]	scary	[0.         0.16917278 0.17104414 0.16580877 0.17444879 0.16500341]

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.	neutral	[0.7253989  0.00772134 0.08065967 0.00883916 0.17429204 0.00308886]	scary	[0.         0.16368043 0.17113692 0.16340545 0.17648345 0.16360435]

First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.	neutral	[0.75587577 0.03261326 0.10930951 0.0126518  0.05251387 0.03703585]	scary	[0.         0.16807944 0.1609356  0.17005344 0.1826347  0.1583232 ]

Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.	neutral	[0.68051773 0.1763269  0.12442115 0.00267336 0.00620629 0.00985453]	happy	[0.         0.17770792 0.16718291 0.1754384  0.17524617 0.16073471]
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.	neutral	[0.6135706  0.03978307 0.13664722 0.0119685  0.06143982 0.1365909 ]	scary	[0.         0.16554487 0.16864886 0.16391258 0.17253458 0.16749081]

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.	scary	[0.12613578 0.04406648 0.11992101 0.22486216 0.4180619  0.06695269]	angry	[0.         0.16231464 0.1656509  0.16369228 0.17386524 0.17455626]

said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.'	neutral	[0.49786457 0.23184134 0.05170033 0.16089198 0.03130834 0.02639344]	scary	[0.         0.1707851  0.16969995 0.17272363 0.17678092 0.16476674]

But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister's dream.	happy	[0.42694244 0.55852747 0.00821297 0.00495433 0.00057242 0.00079035]	happy	[0.         0.18000258 0.16315372 0.17708106 0.17651615 0.15909833]
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.	neutral	[0.35880566 0.0229448  0.18953611 0.03092736 0.1788546  0.21893145]	angry	[0.         0.1677939  0.15756978 0.17843224 0.17351547 0.17987453]
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.	neutral	[0.481972   0.06072959 0.18352771 0.05608674 0.20706166 0.01062235]	scary	[0.         0.1647267  0.16343    0.16676004 0.17458626 0.16940664]
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.	happy	"[2.9371426e-02 8.3480811e-01 2.3399332e-06 1.3581663e-01 6.4960369e-07
