Chapter 8 THE MERMAIDS' LAGOON  If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire.	neutral	[0.824479   0.12765492 0.03455527 0.01331086]	sad	[0.         0.31137254 0.41026843 0.20154572]

When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.	neutral	[0.97650945 0.00768591 0.0050798  0.01072489]	angry	[0.         0.30221841 0.29879296 0.30616349]

The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.	neutral	[0.7558661  0.04126684 0.02650959 0.17635745]	sad	[0.         0.24429997 0.31734339 0.27923038]
